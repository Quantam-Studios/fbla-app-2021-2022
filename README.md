## App Project Description

Our C Hub app was made to tackle the topic of making an app for our school that students may use by FBLA-PBL. It contains multiple pages of resources for students to utilize and refer to. It's main function is to allow for easy access to any school related topics, such as one's schedule or extracurriculars, but contains a lunch menu, planner, and a social media tab as well. In the future, we also are thinkg to integrate a "clubs" tab that will contain a list of all extracurriculars a student may be involved in and interact with it in some way, such as being able to add it into the calendar with just a few taps on some buttons. 
It was made mainly using <insert IDEs>, and used GitHub to combine all pieces of code efficiently. We specifically utilized the language Dart with the Flutter API because it contained many packages (frameworks) that would speed up the development process of our app and also shorten the overall code as well, allowing for maximum efficiency in running the code. Dart is also a fairly new language that is still developing, so it is constantly improving to match today's needs. Another reason we used it for this project specifically is because the code can be configured into Android and iOS platforms, meaning we would only have to code ONCE and we it would still be available for both operating systems. 
Mainly, challenges arose the most when trying to add new code, such as it would not be compatible with the code already in place, or there was a missing aspect to it, or there was just no simply solution for that task. However, as mentioned before, Flutter has many many useful packages and we utilized them as much as we could, if not to the fullest. This way, we would have more time to fix things and have more of a clue for where to look instead of searching through inefficient lines of code wondering if there was a tiny error that was overlooked.
